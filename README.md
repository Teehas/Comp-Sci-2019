In this Repo there is a collection of various CCC practive problems, personal projects, school research, and quite a bit of experimentation to learn various concepts.
Most files are inside the Repl.its subfolder.
The titles to most are fairly self explanitory to their function so feel free to look around and play with the various programs.

PS.
the hangman game, lottery simulator, Line editor, Calandar date, and anagram checker are the most interesting.
